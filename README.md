I'm currently a student of Orsay's IUT (from Paris-Saclay university), and I study Computer Science! I've also studied CompSci in Highschool.

I'm a french native speaker, but I'm as fluent in English, sometimes even better in english when it comes to IT.

I've learned a lot of ***Python***, ***HTML*** and ***CSS***. I cover the basics of ```C``` and ```C++```.

I'm currently learning ***Java***, ***TypeScript***, ***WebAssembly***, ***React***, ***Rust*** and ***Carbon***.

*Be aware that these statistics don't take most of my private projects and what I've studied into account, the overwhelming quantity of Python in this chart is mostly from Highschool projects (•_•)*

As you probably seen, I'm a curious adventutrer when it comes to languages, and I want to try them all before I finish my studies. I'm a fast learner and I've noticed that it gets easier the more I learn.

Of course, I'm not aiming to be a very good or expert developer in all of these languages, but learning the basics of a lot of languages might help me figure out which ones I want to work with in the long term.

I'm getting quite good using C++ and it's libraries, but I'm not sure that's the language I want to use forever. It is really fast, tough!

Frontend is quite fun, but I really like backend. However, if I could, I'd choose to make backend and still have a bit of control over frontend: that's why I think WebAssembly and React are extremely efficient and practical tools when it comes to this.

I've done some SQL and CDM/Database construction, but I'm not the most interested in this right now.

When it comes to my IT culture, I would say I'm an Open Source and Free Software lover, but I love to participate in anything, really! I'm both a Windows and GNU/Linux user, and I try to keep up with security and privacy when it comes to technology.

Concerning the OS I use, I use GNU/linux daily on my laptop (I change between Linux ditros regularly) and Windows on my desktop at home. I'm a shell user on all the OS i use, especially Linux, so I'm comfortable using whatever shell or terminal.
