I'm currently a student of Orsay's IUT (from Paris-Saclay university), and I study Computer Science! I've also studied CompSci in Highschool.

I've learned a lot of Python, HTML and CSS. I cover the basics of C++.

*Be aware that these statistics don't take most of my private projects and what I've studied into account, the overwhelming quantity of Python in this chart is mostly from Highschool projects (•_•)*

I'm currently learning ***Java***, ***TypeScript***, ***WebAssembly***, ***React***, ***Rust*** and ***Carbon***.

As you probably seen, I'm a curious adventutrer when it comes to languages, and I want to try them all before I finish my studies. Of course, I'm not aiming to be a very good or expert developer in all of these languages, but learning the basics of a lot of languages might help me figure out which ones I want to work with in the long term.

I'm getting quite good using C++ and it's libraries, but I'm not sure that's the language I want to use forever. It is really fast, tough!

Frontend is quite fun, but I really like backend. However, if I could, I'd choose to make backend and still have a bit of control over frontend: that's why I think WebAssembly and React are extremely efficient and practical tools when it comes to this.

I've done some SQL and CDM/Database construction, but I'm not the most interested in this right now.

When it comes to my cultural IT beliefs, I would say I'm an Open Source and Free Software lover, but I love to participate in anything, really! I'm both a Windows and GNU/Linux user, and I try to keep up with security and privacy when it comes to technology.
